## Data source

The dataset is derived from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


## "run_analysis.R" script description

The run_analysis.R script that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set (tidy.txt) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 


## The CodeBook

The CodeBook.md file lists and explains the variables and the transformations performed.
